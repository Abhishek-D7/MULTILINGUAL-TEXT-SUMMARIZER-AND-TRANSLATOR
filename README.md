MULTILINGUAL TEXT SUMMARIZER AND TRANSLATOR ðŸ˜Ž 

I recently developed a versatile application that leverages Hugging Face's pre-trained facebook/bart-large-cnn and Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt models. This project integrates text summarization and translation for multiple languages (English, French, German, Hindi) in a single, streamlined application.
Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with a user-friendly Streamlit interface, this tool ensures high accessibility and seamless interactions.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Summarization: Efficiently summarize text in different languages.
Translation: Translate text between English, French, German, and Hindi.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface designed with Streamlit.
